Quiz maker off llm generated mcqs.
![screenshots\startpage.png]

Ever had a environmental sciences quiz the next day and the only material you have on you is a 400 page pdf?
the first plan of action seems to be to upload it to a llm and generate 100s of mcqs.

Well this website quizzes you on them, helps you employ active recall so that the info sticks long term(at least until your exam)

It exists just to curb that small utility >_<

Features:
1. timer
2. export of incorrect questions in a .md file
3. interface designed to be fast paced(no need to take your hands off the keyboard)
